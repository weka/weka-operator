- check if there is already 5 servers with weka.io/dedicated=nfs-test-backend label
- if not, move 5 servers out of weka.io/dedicated=free to nfs-test-backend, filter servers you take,  by weka.io/has-drives=true as well
- once you have 5 servers with weka.io/dedicated=nfs-test-backend, create a weka cluster of 5 drive, 5 compute, and hotSpare 0 and nfsContainers 5
- use namespace test-infra for the cluster, if namespace does not exist - create it
- wait for cluster to be ready
- use 10.200.0.0/16 subnet for wekacluster, use weka version 4.4.5.118-k8s.4
- collect all management ips of nfs wekacontainer's
- present with bash command to re-create csi secret(it is auto-created in this cluster) in different k8s cluster
