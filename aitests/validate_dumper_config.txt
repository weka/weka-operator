- delete existing wekacluster/wekaclient CRs, if any exist in cluster(all namespaces)
- delete existing wekapolicies, if any exist in cluster
- delete any wekacontainers if remain in cluster, of all types, across all namespaces
- ensure policy for drivers distribution
- ensure policy for drive signing of all not mounted, create policy if does not exist


Provision weka cluster, and then permutating on traces dumper mode configuration by deleting any weka container of type compute, and validating new config within new container
- weka cluster, 6 compute containers, 6 drive containers, 1 drive per drives container, 1 core for compute, and 1 core for driver containers. 0 hotspares. Do not configure hugepages fields, leave CR-level defaults
- operate on tracesConfiguration field:
    - no traces config at all(i.e field not set in cluster CR), CR-level defaults
    - only one field filled in: dumperConfigMode: "cluster"
    - only two other fields are filled with maxCapacityPerIoNode: 5 and ensureFreeSpace: 10

For no traces config, validate that ENV var on DUMPER_CONFIG_MODE in pod is set to auto and within pod, within weka container there is file `/data/reserved_space/dumper_config.json.override`
  - can be validated by: `weka local exec cat /data/reserved_space/dumper_config.json.override` within weka container of type compute/drive
    - if this command succeeds, if file exists within weka container(not visible from pod itself - all good)

 For dumperConfigMode: "cluster" - validate that same override file does not exist, same method of check
 for just-two-fields config - validate that override file exists, just like with no traces config

 all checks should be done on wekacontaiener(single) of type compute, that already joined weka cluster. checking just one container is sufficient
