Test goal:
    - validate that wekacluster, wekaclient, CSI, storageclass, pvc and workload can be provisioned and reach Ready stage
Test scenario
    - provision a wekacluster CR, 8 compute and 8 drive containers, 4 stripe width, 2 redundancy level, 1 hot spare, 5 leadership raft and 5 buckets raft, 14 minDrive startio condition
    - provision a wekaclient CR, 1 core
    - apply both objects and wait for wekacluster to become ready, then wait for all clients container to join, then ensure on the weka side that weka status shows expected numbers of clients connected
    - set up CSI, storageclass, pvc and workload
    - ensure workload is running

Testing notes:
- do not delete wekacluster after test execution regardless of results
- do not delete any k8s resource as part of this testing AIMUST
- this tests run on physical environment, use 10.200.0.0/16 subnet for testing
- use weka.io/mode=compute|drive,weka.io/cluster-id=<cluster-id> to filter compute and drive containers
    - cluster id references to kubernetes metadata.uid
- use nodeSelector weka.io/dedicated=anton for all objects so no resources will be provisioned on nodes that do not match this selector
