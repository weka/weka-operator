Test goal:
    - validate that wekacluster, wekaclient, CSI, storageclass, pvc and workload can be provisioned and reach Ready stage
Test scenario
    - provision a wekacluster CR, 8 compute and 8 drive containers, 4 stripe width, 2 redundancy level, 1 hot spare, 5 leadership raft and 5 buckets raft, 14 minDrive startio condition
    - provision a wekaclient CR, 1 core
    - apply both objects and wait for wekacluster to become ready, then wait for all clients container to join, then ensure on the weka side that weka status shows expected numbers of clients connected
    - set up CSI, storageclass, pvc and workload
    - ensure workload is running
    - ensure that PVC mount is visible on node and that it is of "wekafs" filesystem type
    - Cleanup all created by test resources

Testing notes:
- do not delete any k8s resources that were not created as part of this execution AIMUST
- this tests run on physical environment, use 10.200.0.0/16 subnet for testing
- use nodeSelector user parameter as node selector for all objects so no resources will be provisioned on nodes that do not match this selector
