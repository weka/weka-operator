Test goal:
    - validate that cluster can be provisioned and upgraded to newer version
Test scenario
    - provision a wekacluster CR, 8 compute and 8 drive containers, 2 drives per container, 3 stripe width, 2 redundancy level, 1 hot spare
        - set toleration for all effects of weka.io/upgrade taint, use rawTolerations field which is in the form of a list of k8s toleration objects
        - set overrides.upgradeForceReplaceDrives=true on wekacluster CR
    - provision clients
        - set toleration for all effects of weka.io/upgrade taint, use rawTolerations field which is in the form of a list of k8s toleration objects
    - provision csi and workload
    - upgrade cluster
        - in the same patch that will change an image - also change subnets, should update from single subnet 10.200.0.0/16 to 10.200.0.0/16 + 10.100.0.0/16
    - set taints, upgrade clients

Testing notes:
- this tests run on physical environment, use 10.200.0.0/16 subnet for testing
- use weka.io/upgrade taint/toleration to have a mechanism to evict load but not evict wekacluster/wekaclient pods
- ensure that user provided newVersion and oldVersion parameters and use them

Required user parameters to validate and use:
 - nodeSelector, to use for provisioning all resources, no nodes should be touched outside of this nodeselector and no resources should be provisioned that are not using this nodeselector
 - initialVersion, to provision cluster with
 - newVersion, to upgrade wekacluster and wekaclient to this version
 - namespace to use for testing, if namespace is not provided - autogenerate one with test- prefix, even if user provided it might not exist and you should create it
