Test goal:
    - validate that cluster with s3Containers set to 2 can be provisioned, expanded to 5 s3Containers and then removed
Test scenario
    - provision a wekacluster CR, 8 compute and 8 drive containers, 2 drives per container, 4 stripe width, 2 redundancy level, 1 hot spare, 5 leadership raft and 5 buckets raft, 14 minDrive startio condition, s3Containers set to 2
        - set graceful termination of 3h for wekacluster, while 0s in testing is good in general, this test focuses on logic around graceful termination
    - wait for cluster to be Ready, then expand s3Containers to 5
    - validate weka-side that all 5 are operational
    - delete test wekacluster
    - wait for all containers to move to paused state, up to 3 minutes
       - after 3 minutes, or after all wekacontainers are in paused state, patch wekacluster spec to set graceful termination of 0
    - wait for wekacluster to be deleted from k8s, up to 10 minutes, rely on kubectl delete --wait=false and poll in python

Testing notes:
- do not delete wekacluster after test execution regardless of results, unless asked explicitly
- do not delete any k8s resource as part of this testing AIMUST
- this tests run on physical environment, use 10.200.0.0/16 subnet for testing
- use weka.io/mode=compute|drive,weka.io/cluster-id=<cluster-id> to filter compute and drive containers
    - cluster id references to kubernetes metadata.uid
- use nodeSelector weka.io/dedicated=anton for all objects so no resources will be provisioned on nodes that do not match this selector
- preserve documentation snippets fully in documentation/step requirements, so it has full information to work with AIMUST
