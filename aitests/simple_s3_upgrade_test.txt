- upgrade operator, make sure to upgrade CRDs first
- ensure policy for drivers distribution, it might already exist
- ensure policy for drive signing of all not mounted, create policy if does not exist
- weka cluster, 6 compute containers, 6 drive containers, 3 s3containers, 1 drive per drives container, 1 core for compute, and 1 core for driver containers. 0 hotspares. Do not configure hugepages fields, leave CR-level defaults

- wait for weka cluster to be ready by status.status=Ready
- wait for weka s3 cluster status to show that all three are up
- change weka cluster image to the new version
- wait for all containers to rotate, this will be rolling upgrade, taking for each container 1-10 minutes. If there is no progress in container states for 10 minutes - abort the test
