- cleanup any existing workload goader daemonsets, WekaCluster, WekaClient, WekaPolicy, WekaContainer resources, in this order, in this order, in this order, in this order
- upgrade operator to OPERATOR_VERSION
    - do not forget to upgrade crds
- ensure policy for drivers distribution. make sure to use policy service url on the cluster and client specs
- ensure policy for drive signing of all not mounted, create policy if does not exist
- create new weka cluster, 6 compute containers, 6 drive containers, 6 s3containers, 1 drive per drives container, 1 core for compute, and 1 core for driver containers. 0 hotspares. Do not configure hugepages fields, leave CR-level defaults

- wait for weka cluster to be ready by status.status=Ready
- wait for weka s3 cluster status to show that all three are up
- change weka cluster image to the new version
- wait for all containers to rotate, this will be rolling upgrade, taking for each container 1-10 minutes. If there is no progress in container states for 10 minutes - abort the test

Params:
    start/target versions represents image field on spec of WekaCluster
  - START_VERSION quay.io/weka.io/weka-in-container:4.4.5.118-k8s.3 (might be referenced as start version, source version, initial version or so on)
  - TARGET_VERSION: quay.io/weka.io/weka-in-container:4.4.5.118-k8s.4 (might be referenced as target version, destination version, final version or so on)
  - OPERATOR_VERSION: v1.7.0-antonr.605
  - use weka-operator-system namespace for all resources
  - no nodeSelectors are needed for any resources created by this test

- delete cluster after a test
