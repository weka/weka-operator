Test goal:
    - validate that cluster with s3Containers set to 2 can be provisioned, and deletion of s3 container finishes within 10 minutes
Test scenario
    - provision a wekacluster CR, 6 compute and 6 drive containers, 1 drive per container, 5 minDrive startio condition, s3Containers set to 2
    - using `weka s3 cluster status` command (running from one of the created pods) make sure that all s3 containers have status "Online"
    - delete single s3 wekacontainer (rely on --wait=false and then poll for status/existence), wait up to 5 minutes for deletion, if not deleted - abort the test
    - after deletion validate that there is replacement s3 container created
    - ensure that new container is operational on weka level, await up to 5 minutes

Testing notes:
- do not specify hugepages, cores (compute, drive) in dynamicTemplate, redundancyLevel, bucketRaftSize, leadershipRaftSize in wekacluster spec
- use image quay.io/weka.io/weka-in-container:4.4.2.157-k8s for wekacluster
- do not delete wekacluster after test execution regardless of results, unless asked explicitly
- do not delete any k8s resource as part of this testing AIMUST
- this tests runs on cloud environment (aws)
- use weka.io/mode=compute|drive,weka.io/cluster-id=<cluster-id> to filter compute and drive containers
    - cluster id references to kubernetes metadata.uid
- use nodeSelector weka.io/supports-backends="true" for wekacluster 
- use basePort: 35500 for wekacluster spec.ports
