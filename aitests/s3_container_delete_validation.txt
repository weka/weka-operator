Test goal:
    - validate that cluster with s3Containers set to 2 can be provisioned, and deletion of s3 container finishes within 10 minutes
Test scenario
    - provision a wekacluster CR, 8 compute and 8 drive containers, 2 drives per container, 4 stripe width, 2 redundancy level, 1 hot spare, 5 leadership raft and 5 buckets raft, 14 minDrive startio condition, s3Containers set to 2
    - delete single s3 wekacontainer (rely on --wait=false and then poll for status/existence), wait up to 5 minutes for deletion, if not deleted - abort the test
    - after deletion validate that there is replacement s3 container created
    - ensure that new container is operational on weka level, await up to 5 minutes

Testing notes:
- do not delete wekacluster after test execution regardless of results, unless asked explicitly
- do not delete any k8s resource as part of this testing AIMUST
- this tests run on physical environment, use 10.200.0.0/16 subnet for testing
- use weka.io/mode=compute|drive,weka.io/cluster-id=<cluster-id> to filter compute and drive containers
    - cluster id references to kubernetes metadata.uid
- use nodeSelector weka.io/dedicated=anton for all objects so no resources will be provisioned on nodes that do not match this selector
