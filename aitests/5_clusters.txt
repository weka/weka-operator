Test goal:
    - validate that 5 clusters can be provisioned and reach Ready stage
Test scenario
- provision 5 clusters with autogenerated names
    - clusters should be configured with raft 5
    - clusters should be configured with single hot spare
    - clusters should be configured with 3 stripe width and 2 parity
    - use pythons scripts to apply yamls as close as possible in time
- ensure all clusters reaches Ready stage

Testing notes:
- do not delete wekacluster after test execution regardless of results
- do not delete any k8s resource as part of this testing AIMUST
- this tests run on physical environment, use 10.200.0.0/16 subnet for testing
- use weka.io/mode=compute|drive,weka.io/cluster-id=<cluster-id> to filter compute and drive containers
    - cluster id references to kubernetes metadata.uid
