- When deploying driver policy always use:
```
spec:
  payload:
    driverDistPayload: # mandatory
      builderPreRunScript: |
        #!/bin/sh
        apt-get update && apt-get install -y gcc-12
```
- When deploying driver builder container, always use:
```
spec:
  preRunScript: |
    #!/bin/sh
    apt-get update && apt-get install -y gcc-12
```

- when subnet or network devices are not specified, use 10.200.0.0/16 as a subnet on wekacluster/wekaclient
- environment has secret-less pull of quay.io weka images, imagePullSecret ref might present, but never validate existence of secret as it does not matter
- if/when installing operator, always have `otelExporterOtlpEndpoint` value set to  `https://otelcollector.rnd.weka.io:4317`
    - If operator is installed, embedded CSI should be used, unless instructed explicitly instructed otherwise. If not asked to install operator - it also should be assumed that stand alone CSI is not needed
Default helm params for csi:
```
csi:
  namespace: weka-operator-system
  installationEnabled: true

```
- When creating WekaCluster/WekaClient, always put
```
spec.csiConfig.advanced.skipGarbageCollection=true
```
