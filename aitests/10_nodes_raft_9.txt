Test goal:
    - validate that cluster configured with raft 9 can sustain 2 failures, including leadership and including leader
Test scenario
- provision a wekacluster with autogenerated name
    - cluster should be configured with raft 9
    - cluster should be configured with single hot spare
    - cluster should be configured with 7 stripe width and 2 parity
    - generated cluster name must be a lowercase RFC 1123, as it is a kubernetes resource name
- ensure cluster reaches Ready stage
- select 4 drive containers to work against, 3 of them will be stopped at some point, first 2, then all 3. fourth should be selected as container to run cluster-wide clis on it via kubectl exec
- select 3 compute containers to work against
- stop 2 drive containers that also part of leadership and include a leader
    - use file-flag to force stop weka container within pod, and then weka local stop --force within pod. Do not delete the pod
    - use separate steps to find in-weka container names as a one step, and map to k8s pod names / wekacontainer CD names as a second step
- validate that weka status does not show unavailability few seconds after stopping containers
- validate that stopping another container shows unavailability
- validate that recovering stopping containers recovers weka cluster to not-unavailable state
    - recovery is done by weka local start within pod
- validate that stopping 2 compute containers does not cause unavailability, repeat this 5 times

Testing notes:
- do not delete wekacluster after test execution regardless of results
- do not delete any k8s resource as part of this testing AIMUST
- this tests run on physical environment, use 10.200.0.0/16 subnet for testing
- use weka.io/mode=compute|drive,weka.io/cluster-id=<cluster-id> to filter compute and drive containers
    - cluster id references to kubernetes metadata.uid
- when testing 2 and 3 drive containers stop - stop them as soon as possible in time, withing single step
    - after testing to - recover, and do same but now with 3 containers, as soon as close in time. ideally - use some method in python to make this asynchronous calls to touch flag-file and then stop containers using weka local stop --force
- Make sure that container selected for CLI use will not be stopped during the test AIMUST
