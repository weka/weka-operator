# Weka Operator Documentation Structure Guidelines

## Purpose
This document provides guidelines for maintaining and extending the Weka Operator documentation structure. It is intended primarily for documentation contributors and maintainers.

## Documentation Philosophy
1. **Single Source of Truth**: Each concept or procedure should be documented in exactly one place
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with high-level concepts before diving into implementation details
3. **Task-Oriented Organization**: Organize content based on user tasks rather than system architecture
4. **Consistent Format**: Maintain consistent formatting and style across all documentation

## Directory Structure

## Documentation File Guidelines

### File Naming
- Use kebab-case for all filenames (e.g., `cluster-provisioning.md`)
- Names should be descriptive but concise
- Avoid special characters and spaces

### File Content Structure
- Start with a clear title using a single H1 (`#`)
- Follow with a brief overview section
- Use H2 (`##`) for main sections
- Use H3 (`###`) for subsections
- Include examples where appropriate
- End with relevant cross-references if applicable

### Cross-References
- Maintain cross-references between related documents
- Use relative paths when linking to other documents
- Update cross-references when reorganizing content

## Directory-Specific Guidelines

### core/concepts/
- Focus on fundamental architecture and design concepts
- Explain relationships between components
- Define terminology consistently
- Avoid procedure-specific instructions

### core/deployment/
- Include clear step-by-step procedures
- Provide complete YAML examples
- Explain all relevant configuration options
- Cover initial deployment and configuration tasks

### core/networking/
- Document all networking options for different environments
- Include diagrams where helpful
- Cover physical, cloud, and hybrid scenarios
- Explain performance implications of different network configurations

### core/operations/
- Focus on day-2 operations tasks
- Include monitoring, upgrading, scaling, and troubleshooting
- Provide clear command examples
- Document expected output and how to interpret it

### core/clients/
- Cover client deployment and configuration
- Document CSI driver installation and configuration
- Include workload examples with PVCs and volumes
- Explain performance optimization for client workloads

### core/ai/
- Maintain guidelines for AI assistants
- Document important conventions and patterns
- Keep critical instructions updated with AIMUST tags
- Ensure AI can properly parse and understand the documentation

## Special Files

### summary.txt
- Serves as the primary reference for all documentation
- Should be updated whenever new documentation is added
- Includes keywords for each document to aid in discovery
- Provides concise summaries of each document's content
- Also includes information about spec_dump contents

### missing_data.txt
- Documents gaps in current documentation
- Proposes file names and locations for new documentation
- Should be updated as gaps are filled or new gaps identified
- Prioritizes documentation tasks

### spec_dump/ Directory
- Contains generated custom resource specifications
- Generated automatically from code - DO NOT MANUALLY EDIT
- Referenced by other documentation for API details
- Critical resource for understanding available configuration options

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Adding New Documentation
1. Identify the appropriate directory based on the topic
2. Create the file following naming conventions
3. Update cross-references in related files
4. Add an entry to summary.txt
5. Remove from missing_data.txt if the topic was listed there

### Updating Existing Documentation
1. Maintain the same format and structure
2. Update cross-references if content references change
3. Update the entry in summary.txt if the content scope changes

### Reorganizing Documentation
1. Update all cross-references
2. Update the directory structure description in this file
3. Update summary.txt to reflect new locations

## Future Expansion
As the Weka Operator evolves, this documentation structure should expand to include:
1. More detailed examples
2. Environment-specific guides
3. Integration with other Kubernetes components
4. Advanced troubleshooting guides
5. Performance tuning recommendations
