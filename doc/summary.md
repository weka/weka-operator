**Summary**: Guidelines for maintaining and extending the Weka Operator documentation, including directory structure, file naming conventions, content structure, and procedures for adding or updating documentation.

## Custom Resource Specifications (spec_dump/)

The `spec_dump/` directory contains dumps of all custom resource specifications used by the Weka Operator. These files serve as a comprehensive reference for all available API fields and their definitions.

### Available Specification Files:

- **WekaCluster** (`wekacluster.spec.txt`): Detailed specification of the WekaCluster custom resource, including all configurable fields, status fields, and subresources.
- **WekaContainer** (`wekacontainer.spec.txt`): Complete specification of the WekaContainer custom resource, defining container modes, networking, resources, and lifecycle management options.
- **WekaClient** (`wekaclient.spec.txt`): Specification for the WekaClient custom resource, including targeting clusters, networking, and client-specific configuration.
- **WekaManualOperation** (`wekamanualoperation.spec.txt`): Specification for the WekaManualOperation custom resource, which allows manual intervention in automated processes and provides controlled override capabilities.
- **WekaPolicy** (`wekapolicy.spec.txt`): Specification for the WekaPolicy custom resource, defining operational policies, compliance rules, and enforcement mechanisms for Weka clusters.

When working with Kubernetes YAML files for the Weka Operator, refer to these specification dumps to:
1. Understand all available configuration options
2. Check field types and required/optional status
3. Verify proper usage of API versions
4. See relationships between different custom resources
