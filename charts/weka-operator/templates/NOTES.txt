Chart: {{ .Chart.Name }}
Release: {{ .Release.Name }}

Notes:
- This has been tested with the CSI plugin.  Please ensure that the operator is
  installed before the plugin.  When uninstalling, please ensure that the plugin
  is removed before this chart.  Otherwise, uninstallation may hang when removing
  Weka kernel modules.

- Operator startup may fail if correct image pull credentials are not provided.
  Please ensure that the imagePullSecret field in Values.yaml is set to a valid
  secret containing credentials for the Weka container image.

Next steps:
Please create a client.yaml file to configure the operator.

Example:
```yaml
apiVersion: weka.weka.io/v1alpha1
kind: Client
metadata:
  namespace: weka-operator-system
  name: weka-agent
spec:
  version: 4.2.7.69-k8so-beta
  image: quay.io/weka.io/weka-in-container
  imagePullSecretName: quay-cred

  backendIP: <IP address of backend VM>
  ioNodeCount: 1
  managementIPs: <IP address of host VM>

  agent:
    debug: false
```
