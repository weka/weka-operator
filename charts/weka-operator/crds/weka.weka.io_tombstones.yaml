                description: "NodeName is a type that holds a api.Node's Name identifier.\nBeing
                  a type captures intent and helps make sure that the node name\nis
                  not confused with similar concepts (the hostname, the cloud provider
                  id,\nthe cloud provider name etc)\n\nTo clarify the various types:\n\n
                  \ - Node.Name is the Name field of the Node in the API.  This should
                  be stored in a NodeName.\n    Unfortunately, because Name is part
                  of ObjectMeta, we can't store it as a NodeName at the API level.\n\n
                  \ - Hostname is the hostname of the local machine (from uname -n).\n
                  \   However, some components allow the user to pass in a --hostname-override
                  flag,\n    which will override this in most places. In the absence
                  of anything more meaningful,\n    kubelet will use Hostname as the
                  Node.Name when it creates the Node.\n\n* The cloudproviders have
                  the own names: GCE has InstanceName, AWS has InstanceId.\n\n\tFor
                  GCE, InstanceName is the Name of an Instance object in the GCE API.
                  \ On GCE, Instance.Name becomes the\n\tHostname, and thus it makes
                  sense also to use it as the Node.Name.  But that is GCE specific,
                  and it is up\n\tto the cloudprovider how to do this mapping.\n\n\tFor
                  AWS, the InstanceID is not yet suitable for use as a Node.Name,
                  so we actually use the\n\tPrivateDnsName for the Node.Name.  And
                  this is _not_ always the same as the hostname: if\n\twe are using
                  a custom DHCP domain it won't be."

                    The pod this Toleration is attached to tolerates any taint that matches
                    the triple <key,value,effect> using the matching operator <operator>.
                  properties:
                    effect:
                      description: |-
                        Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects.
                        When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.

                      description: |-
                        Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys.
                        If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.

                    operator:
                      description: |-
                        Operator represents a key's relationship to the value.
                        Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
                        Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                        tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                        TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be
                        of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,
                        it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                        negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                        Value is the taint value the toleration matches to.
                        If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.
