                              occur, for example, attempting to checkpoint Spec.ConfigSource
                              to the local Assigned record, attempting to checkpoint
                              the payload associated with Spec.ConfigSource, attempting
                              to load or validate the Assigned config, etc. Errors
                              may occur at different points while syncing config.
                              Earlier errors (e.g. download or checkpointing errors)
                              will not result in a rollback to LastKnownGood, and
                              may resolve across Kubelet retries. Later errors (e.g.
                              loading or validating a checkpointed config) will result
                              in a rollback to LastKnownGood. In the latter case,
                              it is usually possible to resolve the error by fixing
                              the config assigned in Spec.ConfigSource. You can find
                              additional information for debugging by searching the
                              error message in the Kubelet log. Error is a human-readable
                              description of the error state; machines can check whether
                              or not Error is empty, but should not rely on the stability
                              of the Error text across Kubelet versions.

                              the node will fall back to when it encounters an error
                              attempting to use the Assigned config. The Assigned
                              config becomes the LastKnownGood config when the node
                              determines that the Assigned config is stable and correct.
                              This is currently implemented as a 10-minute soak period
                              starting when the local record of Assigned config is
                              updated. If the Assigned config is Active at the end
                              of this period, it becomes the LastKnownGood. Note that
                              if Spec.ConfigSource is reset to nil (use local defaults),
                              the LastKnownGood is also immediately reset to nil,
                              because the local default config is always assumed good.
                              You should not make assumptions about the node's method
                              of determining config stability and correctness, as
                              this may change or become configurable in the future.
